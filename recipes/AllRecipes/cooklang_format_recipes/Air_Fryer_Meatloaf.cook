Preheat an air fryer to 392 degrees F (200 degrees C).

Combine ground @beef{1%pound}, @onion{1%}, @bread crumbs{3%tablespoons}, @thyme{1%tablespoon}, @egg{1%}, @salt{1%teaspoon}, and @pepper{None%} in a bowl. Knead and mix thoroughly. Transfer mixture to a small loaf pan. Smooth the top, press in @mushrooms{2%}, and coat with @olive oil{1%tablespoon}.

Roast meatloaf in the preheated air fryer until nicely browned, about 25 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (72 degrees C).

Let meatloaf rest at least 10 minutes before slicing into wedges and serving.
