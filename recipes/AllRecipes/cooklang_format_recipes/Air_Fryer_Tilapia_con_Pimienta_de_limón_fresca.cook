Preheat the air fryer to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C) for 3 minutes.

Meanwhile, rinse tilapia fillets and pat dry with a paper towel.

Mix together @@lemon{4%wedges} zest{2%tablespoons}, @olive oil{2%tablespoons}, @garlic{2%cloves}, pepper, and @salt{1‚ÅÑ2%teaspoon} in a small bowl until well combined. Rub over tops of fillets, then sprinkle lightly with @paprika{1%pinch}. Lightly coat the air fryer basket with @cooking spray{None%}. Arrange fillets evenly in the basket, spice-side up. Do not crowd; if needed, cook in batches.

Cook in the preheated air fryer until fish flakes easily with a fork, 7 to 10 minutes. Remove fillets to a plate and garnish with parsley. Serve with @lemon{4%wedges} wedges.

Cook time will depend on the thickness of your fillets and the type of air fryer used.
