Preheat the air fryer to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).

Place halved @Brussels sprouts{12%} in a bowl; sprinkle with steak seasoning and toss to coat.

Wrap a half slice of @bacon{12%slices} around a Brussels sprout half and place seam-side-down in the basket of the air fryer. Repeat with remaining @bacon{12%slices} and @Brussels sprouts{12%}.

Cook for 10 minutes undisturbed. Using tongs, transfer to a plate and serve immediately.
