Preheat an air fryer to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).

Rub potatoes with @olive oil{2%tablespoons} and season with salt, pepper, @garlic powder{1⁄2%teaspoon}, and @parsley{1⁄2%teaspoon}. Place potatoes in the air fryer basket.

Cook in the preheated air fryer until potatoes are soft, 40 to 50 minutes, depending on potato size.

Slice potatoes lengthwise. Pinch both sides of each potato, using your hands and forcing potatoes to open, until the fluffy insides start to come out. Add 1 tablespoon of @butter{4%tablespoons} into each potato.
