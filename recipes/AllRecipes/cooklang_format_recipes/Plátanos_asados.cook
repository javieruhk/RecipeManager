Gather all ingredients.

Preheat an air fryer to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C) according to manufacturer's instructions. Line the air fryer basket, if desired.

Place @banana{1%} slices into the basket, making sure that they are not touching; cook in batches if necessary. Mist @banana{1%} slices with @avocado oil{None%}.

Cook in the air fryer for 5 minutes. Remove the basket and flip @banana{1%} slices carefully (they will be soft). Cook until @banana{1%} slices are browned and caramelized, an additional 2 to 3 minutes. Carefully remove from basket.
