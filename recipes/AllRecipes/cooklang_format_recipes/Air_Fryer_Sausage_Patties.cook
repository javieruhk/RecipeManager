Grab your ingredients, and preheat an air fryer to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Lightly grease the inside of the air fryer basket with nonstick spray.

Arrange @sausage patties{1%package} in a single layer in the air fryer basket.

Cook in the preheated air fryer for 5 minutes; flip the patties and cook about 3 minutes more. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center of a patty should read at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C).

Serve hot and enjoy!
