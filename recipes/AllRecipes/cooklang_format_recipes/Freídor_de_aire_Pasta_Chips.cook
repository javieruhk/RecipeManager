Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil; add pasta and cook, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 8 minutes. Drain, but do not rinse. Let sit for 2 minutes.

Preheat an air fryer to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).

Meanwhile, transfer pasta to a large bowl and drizzle with @olive oil{1%tablespoon}; stir in @Parmesan cheese{1⁄2%cup}, @garlic powder{1%teaspoon}, @Italian seasoning{1%teaspoon}, and @salt{1⁄2%teaspoon} until evenly combined. Arrange 1/4 of the pasta in a single layer in the air fryer basket.

Cook in the preheated air fryer for 5 minutes; flip and cook 2 to 3 minutes more. Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate and break apart any pasta chips that have stuck together; let cool completely. Repeat with remaining pasta.

All air fryers are not created equal. Mine is just under 4 quarts and I was able to fit 1/4 of the pasta at one time.
