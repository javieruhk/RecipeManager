Set the air fryer temperature to 380 degrees F (180 degrees C).

Place frozen @chicken strips{25%ounces} in the air fryer basket, without touching or overcrowding.

Cook until crispy, 11 to 12 minutes. The color will not change much. You may have to cook in batches depending on the size of your air fryer, and cooking time may vary depending on the brand and size of your air fryer.

Remove from the air fryer and serve immediately.

You do not need to spray the basket or the @chicken strips{25%ounces} with cooking spray, flip the strips halfway through, or even preheat the air fryer. If there are any leftovers, they can be reheated in the air fryer for 2 to 3 minutes.
