Preheat air fryer to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Spray the air fryer basket with cooking spray or use a parchment liner.

Place @chickpeas{1%can} on a paper towel-lined plate to dry, patting down with another paper towel on top. Add dried @chickpeas{1%can} to a medium bowl, drizzle with @avocado oil{3⁄4%tablespoon}, sprinkle with Tajin, @garlic powder{1⁄4%teaspoon}, and cayenne, and toss to coat.

Transfer @chickpeas{1%can} to the air fryer basket, and cook, stirring or shaking halfway through, until you reach your desired crispness, 12 to 15 minutes. Cooking time may vary depending on the brand and size of your air fryer.

Season with @salt{None%} and allow @chickpeas{1%can} to cool slightly.

If you don't have @avocado oil{3⁄4%tablespoon}, use olive oil. Being sure the @chickpeas{1%can} are dry will help them crisp up and the seasoning to stick better. Store the cooled @chickpeas{1%can} in an airtight container at room temperature for up to a week. If they get soft, place them back in the air fryer for a couple minutes to crisp up.
