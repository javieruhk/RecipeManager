Preheat an air fryer to 390 degrees F (200 degrees C) according to manufacturer's instructions.

Lay @bacon{1⁄2%package} in the air fryer basket in a single layer; some overlap is okay.

Fry for 8 minutes. Flip and continue cooking until @bacon{1⁄2%package} is crisp, about 7 minutes more.

Transfer cooked @bacon{1⁄2%package} to a plate lined with paper towels to soak up excess grease.
