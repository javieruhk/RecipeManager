Preheat the air fryer to 380 degrees F (190 degrees C).

Cut the top off the head of @garlic{1%head} and place on a square piece of @aluminum foil{None%}. Bring the foil up and around @garlic{1%head}. Pour @olive oil{1%teaspoon} on top and season with @salt{1⁄4%teaspoon} and @pepper{1⁄4%teaspoon}. Close ends of foil over @garlic{1%head}, creating a pouch.

Air fry until @garlic{1%head} is soft, 16 to 20 minutes. Open the foil pouch very carefully, as hot steam will escape.
