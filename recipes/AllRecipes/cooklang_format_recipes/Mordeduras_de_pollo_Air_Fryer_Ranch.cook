Combine @chicken{1%pound}, @avocado oil{2%tablespoons}, white @vinegar{1%tablespoon}, ranch powder, @garlic powder{1%teaspoon}, @salt{1⁄2%teaspoon}, and @pepper{1⁄2%teaspoon} in a large bowl. Stir well until the @chicken{1%pound} is coated, cover, and marinate in the fridge for 30 to 60 minutes, but not much longer, as the texture will become mushy.

Preheat the air fryer to 380 degrees F (190 degrees C). Place @chicken{1%pound} cubes in the air fryer basket in a single layer, not touching.

Air fry until @chicken{1%pound} is no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, flipping once when the edges start to brown, being sure not to overcook, 8 to 11 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted near the bone should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Your cooking time may vary depending on the brand and size of your air fryer, and you may need to cook in batches.

Sprinkle the @chicken{1%pound} with @Cheddar cheese{3%tablespoons}. Return to the air fryer until cheese melts, for about 30 seconds. Serve warm, garnished with chopped @parsley{1%tablespoon}.

If you don't have @avocado oil{2%tablespoons}, sub vegetable or canola oil.
