Preheat an air fryer to 360 degrees F (180 degrees C).

Place drummies in a large bowl. Add @olive oil{None%tablespoons}, @garlic powder{1%teaspoon}, @salt{1⁄2%teaspoon}, and @pepper{⁄%teaspoon}. Mix until evenly combined. Spread out drummies in the basket of the air fryer.

Cook drummies for 25 minutes.

Using tongs, remove drummies from the air fryer and place in a large bowl. Pour barbecue over the top and shake to coat.

Place coated drummies back in the basket of the air fryer. Cook until drummies are no longer pink at the bone and the juices run clear, about 5 more minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted near the bone should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Serve immediately.
