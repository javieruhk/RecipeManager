Preheat an air fryer to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).

Place flour in a bowl. Whisk @egg{1%} and @milk{1‚ÅÑ4%cup} in a separate bowl. Combine panko, salt, and @pepper{1%teaspoon} in a third bowl.

Coat @calamari rings{1%pound} first in flour, then in @egg{1%} mixture, and finally in panko mixture.

Place rings in the basket of the air fryer so that none overlap. Work in batches if needed. Spray tops with nonstick @cooking spray{None%}.

Cook in the preheated air fryer for 4 minutes. Flip rings, spray with nonstick @cooking spray{None%}, and cook until browned and crispy, about 3 minutes more.
