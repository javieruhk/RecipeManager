Spread @mayonnaise{2%tablespoons} on one side of each slice of @bread{8%slices}. With mayo side down, lightly spread 4 slices of @bread{8%slices} with @Dijon mustard{2%tablespoons}, evenly top each with @Swiss cheese{4%slices}, ham slices, folded to fit, and pickle slices. Place the remaining 4 @bread{8%slices} slices on the sandwiches, mayo side up, and lightly press sandwiches to close.

Preheat the air fryer to 380 degrees F (193 degrees C). Spray the air fryer basket with @cooking spray{None%} or line with a parchment liner.

Place sandwiches in the air fryer basket in a single layer, leaving some space around them. You may have to cook the sandwiches in batches, depending on the size of your fryer.

Cook until sandwiches begin to brown, 3 to 4 minutes. Flip, and cook until cheese has melted and sandwiches are golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes more. Slice sandwiches in half and serve warm.

Mayonnaise is the only thing I use these days on grilled sandwiches. Itâ€™s always ready, spreads easily, browns beautifully, and has no mayo flavor. But you can use butter, if you prefer. Air fryer cooking times may vary depending on the brand and size. So watch your sandwiches closely, especially toward the end of cooking.
